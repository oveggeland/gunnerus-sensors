All function calls in loop() should be as efficient as possible. This is crucial for optimal timing performance.

- No serial prints, this is very slow... Use it only for debugging
- Don't wait wait for response, e.g. in NTP requests. Send a request, exit the loop, check for an answer next time around. This will free up resources while waiting for a response.
- Never use delay()
